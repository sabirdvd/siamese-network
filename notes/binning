* **Goal**: Given a conversation context, select response from a *set* of candidates.

* **Candidate** Set: All *positive* examples in Ubuntu corpus v2
    ```
    prep_data/store_train_candidates.sh $DATA_DIR
    ```
  * Unique: 435,953 / 499,873

* **Bin Candidates**
  * Train a word2vec to find *almost* similar words
  ```
  model = Word2Vec(iterator, min_count=10, size=128)
  ```
  where  `iterator` goes through `train.txt1`, `train.txt2` and only selects positive label pairs

    ```
    ./train_word2vec.sh $DATA_DIR
    ```

  * Next cluster words which have have high cosine similarity `sim > 0.7`
    ```
    ./create_clusters.sh $DATA_DIR

    wc -l word_clusters.out
    6707 word_clusters.out
    ```
    Clusters *exclude* stopwords, see `word2vec/create_stopwords.sh`

  * Bins are created based on word-clusters in candidates.

    ```
    prep-data/bin_candidates.sh $DATA_DIR
    ```

    Bins: 308,404 (Candidates: 435,953)
    SW (StopWord Bins)
    ```
    cat ~/data/ubuntu/data/candidates.txt.bin | grep SW | wc -l
    23,814
    ```

* Find a representative candidate from each bin

  * Pick a candidate which has maximum words from Top 10k words in corpus
  * In case there are multiple options, select a random candidate.
